# SwaraNighantuvu
This app is designed for music students to document and revisit their learning. It converts Swaras followed by numbers and dots into properly notated musical notes, overcoming the limitations of standard text editors. Entries can be saved to a personal Excel file and downloaded for future reference.
Use dots (.) before or after a note to indicate lower or higher octaves respectively.
Example: .sa for lower octave, sa. for higher octave
Use numbers to indicate note variations or positions, if applicable.
Separate each note with a space.
ðŸŽµ Example Input Format
.N â†’ represents lower octave Ni
S R1 G2 M2 P D2 N1 â†’ standard notes with specific swarasthana (variations)
S. â†’ represents higher octave Sa (note the dot after S)
Each note should be separated by a space for accurate formatting.
